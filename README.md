# SQL Refresher

## Learning Goals

Review SQL fundamentals

## Overview

There are a number of free, interactive tutorials that review SQL fundamentals. These include exercises similar to those you might be given during an interview or tasks you might face once you're hired.

## Main Activity

We recommend completeing three sections from [Khan Academy's Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) course. It provides instructional videos and hands-on activities re-inforcing the SQL you learned in the course. We anticipate that it will take about 5 hours to complete:

1. [SQL basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#sql-basics)
2. [More advanced SQL queries](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#more-advanced-sql-queries)
3. [Relational queries in SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#relational-queries-in-sql)

If you have trouble with these activites, we recommend returning to this after re-doing the activities from the SQL section(s) from your Learn.co track.

## Supplemental Activities

If you have already completed this course, prefer a shorter course, want more review of the basics, or have additional time, here are more tutorials we recommend. They are in order from easiest to hardest, so you can choose based on your level of comfort with SQL:

1. [Codecademy's Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) course has four free interactive lessons that do not require a Pro subscription. It should take about 3 hours.
2. [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) proceeds from basic queries to more complicated queries and row/table manipulation. It should take about 3 hours.
3. [SelectStarSQL](https://selectstarsql.com/) reviews SQL fundamentals in the context of a research project about capital punishment. It should take about 3 hours.
4. [Kaggle's Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) course teaches SQL fundamentals in Jupyter Notebooks using Python and Google BigQuery. It should take about 5 hours.
